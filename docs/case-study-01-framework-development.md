# HUMMBL Case Study #1: Framework-Driven Product Development

**Subject:** Reuben Bowlby, Chief Engineer, HUMMBL LLC  
**Duration:** 22+ months (January 2024 – November 2025)  
**Domain:** Cognitive framework development, AI-assisted product engineering  
**Outcome:** Production-ready Base120 mental models system deployed at hummbl.io

---

## Executive Summary

A solo founder used the HUMMBL Base120 mental models framework to architect, validate, and deploy the framework itself—a meta-recursive application demonstrating the system's power. Over 18 months, the project evolved from a 42-model prototype to a complete 120-model cognitive system, achieved 9.2/10 validation quality, and coordinated 4+ AI agents in parallel execution workflows. The framework now serves as both product and methodology.

## The Challenge

**Starting Point:** A collection of mental models used informally for problem-solving, with no systematic organization, validation methodology, or production infrastructure.

**Complexity Factors:**

- Solo founder with competing time demands (fitness training, government contracts, consulting)
- No existing product—building the plane while flying it
- Need for empirical validation, not just theoretical completeness
- Multi-system coordination across AI platforms with different capabilities
- Technical infrastructure (API, MCP server, web deployment) required alongside content

**Wickedness Score:** 20/30 (Tier 4 - Wicked Problem)

- 6+ significant variables
- Multiple stakeholder types (developers, researchers, practitioners)
- Low predictability of market reception
- High interdependency between models
- Partially reversible decisions

## The HUMMBL Approach

### Phase 1: Foundation (Jan–Jun 2024)

**Models Applied:**

- **DE3 Modularization** — Established 6-transformation architecture (P, IN, CO, DE, RE, SY)
- **P1 First Principles** — Defined what a "mental model" actually is vs. heuristics/frameworks
- **CO8 Layered Abstraction** — Created Base-N scaling system (Base6 → Base120)

**Key Decision:** Base42 (6×7 models) identified as "practical optimum" for wicked problems. This became the validation benchmark—if Base42 couldn't solve a Tier 4 problem, the framework had gaps.

**Outcome:** Formal architecture established. Priority rankings assigned to all models.

---

### Phase 2: Expansion (Jul–Sep 2024)

**Models Applied:**

- **RE4 Iterative Refinement** — Expanded from Base42 → Base90 based on practitioner feedback
- **SY19 Meta-Model Selection** — Developed criteria for when to use which Base-N level
- **IN7 Boundary Analysis** — Defined transformation interdependencies and information flow

**Key Decision:** Formalized operator algebra for model composition. Models don't operate in isolation—systematic combination creates emergent analytical power.

**Outcome:** Base90 complete with formal language specification. Bernard Analytical Agent prototype built.

---

### Phase 3: Validation (Oct 2024)

**Models Applied:**

- **DE7 Root Cause Analysis** — Identified why previous validation attempts felt incomplete
- **SY18 Measurement & Telemetry** — Created 5-question wickedness scoring rubric
- **RE6 Feedback Loops** — Established quality gates with automated checking

**Pivot Point:** Shifted from subjective tier classification to quantitative scoring:

| Dimension | Score Range |
|-----------|-------------|
| Variables | 0-5 |
| Stakeholders | 0-5 |
| Predictability | 0-5 |
| Interdependencies | 0-5 |
| Reversibility | 0-5 |
| **Total** | **0-30** |

**Tier Mapping:**

- Tier 1 (Simple): 1-9 points
- Tier 2 (Moderate): 10-14 points
- Tier 3 (Complex): 15-19 points
- Tier 4 (Wicked): 20-24 points
- Tier 5 (Super-Wicked): 25-30 points

**Outcome:** Empirical validation methodology. Base-N coverage testing against real problems.

---

### Phase 4: Productization (Oct–Nov 2024)

**Models Applied:**

- **CO12 Standardization** — Unified model format (code, name, definition, example)
- **SY20 Systems-of-Systems Coordination** — Multi-agent orchestration protocols
- **P8 Stakeholder Mapping** — Identified user segments (developers via MCP, researchers via API, practitioners via web)

**Multi-Agent Coordination Breakthrough:**

Developed SITREP protocol for parallel AI execution:

| Agent | Role | Capabilities |
|-------|------|--------------|
| Claude Sonnet 4.5 | Lead Architect | Strategic planning, documentation, orchestration |
| ChatGPT-5 | Validator | Quality assurance, gap analysis, verification gates |
| Windsurf Cascade | Executor | Code implementation, environment management |
| Cursor | Specialist | Direct code execution, real-time debugging |

**Protocol Features:**

- Military-style situation reports for unambiguous communication
- Authorization codes for autonomous execution boundaries
- Parallel task assignment with merge gates
- Quality checkpoints before phase transitions

**Outcome:** 120/120 models validated at 9.2/10 average quality. Production deployment at hummbl.io.

---

### Phase 5: Infrastructure (Nov 2024 – Present)

**Models Applied:**

- **DE3 Modularization** — Separated concerns: web UI, API, MCP server
- **SY18 Measurement & Telemetry** — Built chaos engineering test suite
- **RE7 Continuous Integration** — Automated quality gates, nightly regression

**Technical Deliverables:**

| Component | Status | Metrics |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Web UI (hummbl.io) | Production | React + Cloudflare |
| MCP Server | Production | 140 chaos tests, 100% pass |
| API Layer | In Progress | Cloudflare Workers + D1 |
| Documentation | Complete | 6 tools, full schema |

---

## Results

### Quantitative Outcomes

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Models Validated | 120/120 (100%) |
| Quality Score | 9.2/10 average |
| Test Coverage | 140 chaos tests |
| Pass Rate | 100% |
| Development Time | 18 months |
| Team Size | 1 human + 4 AI agents |

### Qualitative Outcomes

Framework Self-Validation: The project proved Base120 can handle Tier 4 (Wicked) problems. The framework was used to build itself—meta-recursive validation.

Multi-Agent Scalability: SITREP protocol demonstrated 4x parallel execution without conflicts. Communication clarity eliminated rework from misalignment.

Sustainable Velocity: Solo founder maintained progress alongside full-time job and other obligations through systematic decomposition and agent delegation.

### Evidence References

- **Validation Issues:** 120 GitLab issues with embedded evidence blocks (see `gitlab.com/hummbl/base120-validation/issues`).
- **Quality Rubric:** Wickedness scoring methodology documented in the HUMMBL validation rubric (`docs/validation/wickedness-rubric.md`).
- **Chaos Test Suite:** MCP server chaos tests located at `tests/chaos-runner.js` and `tests/chaos-runner-extended.js`.

## Key Learnings

### What Worked

1. **Base-N Scaling** — Not every problem needs Base120. Matching complexity to problem tier prevented over-engineering.

2. **Quantitative Validation** — The 5-question wickedness rubric replaced subjective judgment with reproducible scoring.

3. **Multi-Agent Coordination** — SITREP protocol turned AI tools from assistants into autonomous team members with defined responsibilities.

4. **Quality Gates** — Automated checks (metrics validation, citation linting, test suites) caught issues before they compounded.

### What Would Change

1. **Earlier MCP Investment** — The Model Context Protocol server should have been built sooner to enable AI-native distribution.

2. **User Testing Timing** — Production deployment happened before user acquisition infrastructure. Should have parallelized.

3. **Documentation-First** — Some architectural decisions were made before being documented, requiring reconstruction later.

## Models Used (Summary)

| Transformation | Models Applied | Primary Use |
|----------------|----------------|-------------|
| P (Perspective) | P1, P8 | Problem framing, stakeholder identification |
| IN (Inversion) | IN7 | Boundary analysis, constraint mapping |
| CO (Composition) | CO8, CO12 | Architecture design, standardization |
| DE (Decomposition) | DE3, DE7 | Modularization, root cause analysis |
| RE (Recursion) | RE4, RE6, RE7 | Iteration, feedback loops, CI/CD |
| SY (Systems) | SY18, SY19, SY20 | Measurement, meta-selection, coordination |

---

## Conclusion

HUMMBL Base120 successfully powered its own development—a rigorous test of framework validity. The combination of systematic mental models, quantitative validation, and multi-agent coordination enabled a solo founder to build a production-grade cognitive system in 18 months.

**The meta-recursive proof:** If a framework can build itself, it can build anything at equivalent complexity.
