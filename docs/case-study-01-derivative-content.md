# HUMMBL Case Study #1 - Derivative Content Package

## 1. X/Twitter Thread (10 posts)

### Post 1 (Hook)
I built a 120-model mental models framework using... the framework itself.

Meta-recursive product development. Here's what 22 months of framework-driven building taught me:

🧵👇

### Post 2 (Problem)
Started with a mess:
- Mental models scattered across notes
- No validation methodology
- Zero production infrastructure
- Solo founder, full-time job, multiple clients

Wickedness score: 20/30 (Tier 4 problem)

### Post 3 (Architecture)
First breakthrough: 6 transformations, not random categories.

P - Perspective
IN - Inversion  
CO - Composition
DE - Decomposition
RE - Recursion
SY - Systems

Everything maps to these 6. Always.

### Post 4 (Scaling)
Second breakthrough: Base-N scaling.

Base6 = 6 models (core literacy)
Base42 = 42 models (wicked problems)
Base120 = 120 models (pedagogical ceiling)

Match complexity to problem tier. Don't over-engineer.

### Post 5 (Validation)
Third breakthrough: Quantitative wickedness scoring.

5 questions, 0-30 points:
- Variables
- Stakeholders
- Predictability
- Interdependencies
- Reversibility

Replaced vibes with math.

### Post 6 (Multi-Agent)
Fourth breakthrough: AI agents as team members.

Claude = Lead Architect
ChatGPT = Validator
Windsurf = Executor
Cursor = Specialist

SITREP protocol for coordination. 4x parallel execution.

### Post 7 (Results)
The numbers:

✅ 120/120 models validated
✅ 9.2/10 quality score
✅ 140 chaos tests
✅ 100% pass rate
✅ 1 human + 4 AI agents
✅ 22 months

### Post 8 (Meta-Proof)
The meta-recursive proof:

If a framework can build itself, it can build anything at equivalent complexity.

Base120 passed its own test.

### Post 9 (Learnings)
What I'd do differently:

1. Build MCP server earlier (AI-native distribution)
2. Parallelize user acquisition with development
3. Document decisions BEFORE making them

### Post 10 (CTA)
The framework is live at hummbl.io

MCP server for Claude Desktop: @hummbl/mcp-server

Full case study: https://github.com/hummbl-dev/mcp-server/blob/main/docs/case-study-01-framework-development.md

What's your Tier 4 problem? Let's see if Base120 can crack it.

## 2. LinkedIn Post (Long-form)

**22 months ago, I had a problem.**

Mental models everywhere. Notes, books, scattered insights. No system. No validation. No product.

Today: 120 validated models. 9.2/10 quality score. 140 automated tests. Production deployment.

**The twist?** I used the framework to build the framework.

Here's what meta-recursive product development looks like:

**Phase 1: Architecture**
Applied DE3 (Modularization) to create 6 transformation categories. Applied CO8 (Layered Abstraction) to design Base-N scaling. Base42 became the "practical optimum" for wicked problems.

**Phase 2: Validation**
Replaced subjective judgment with a 5-question, 30-point wickedness rubric. Every model got empirically tested against real problems.

**Phase 3: Multi-Agent Coordination**
This is where it got interesting.

I'm a solo founder with a full-time job. Traditional development timeline: 3-5 years.

My solution: Treat AI systems as team members with defined roles.

- Claude Sonnet 4.5: Lead Architect (strategy, documentation)
- ChatGPT-5: Validator (QA, gap analysis)
- Windsurf Cascade: Executor (implementation)
- Cursor: Specialist (debugging)

Military-style SITREP protocol for coordination. Authorization codes for autonomous execution boundaries.

Result: 4x parallel execution. Zero rework from misalignment.

**The meta-recursive proof:**

If a framework can successfully build itself, it can handle any problem at equivalent complexity.

Base120 passed its own test.

**What's next:**
- MCP server for Claude Desktop (live now)
- API for developers
- Case studies from external users

If you're working on a Tier 4 (wicked) problem—multiple stakeholders, low predictability, high interdependency—I'd love to hear about it.

The framework is free at hummbl.io. DM me if you want to be a case study.

## 5. Email/Newsletter Version

**Subject:** I used a framework to build itself (here's what happened)

Hey,

22 months ago I started building HUMMBL—a mental models framework for wicked problems.

The meta part: I used the framework to build the framework.

**The challenge:**
- Solo founder with a full-time job
- No existing product or infrastructure  
- Needed empirical validation, not just theory
- Had to coordinate multiple AI systems

**The approach:**
1. Six transformations (P, IN, CO, DE, RE, SY)
2. Base-N scaling (match complexity to problem tier)
3. Quantitative wickedness scoring (5 questions, 30 points)
4. Multi-agent coordination (Claude + ChatGPT + Windsurf + Cursor)

**The results:**
- 120/120 models validated
- 9.2/10 average quality
- 140 chaos tests, 100% pass
- 22 months, 1 human + 4 AI agents

The meta-recursive proof: if a framework can build itself, it can handle anything at equivalent complexity.

**Want to try it?**
- Web: hummbl.io (free)
- Claude Desktop: @hummbl/mcp-server
- Full case study: https://github.com/hummbl-dev/mcp-server/blob/main/docs/case-study-01-framework-development.md

If you're working on a wicked problem—multiple stakeholders, low predictability, high complexity—reply and tell me about it. Looking for case study #2 and #3.

Chief Engineer, HUMMBL

## 6. Hacker News / Reddit Post

**Title:** I built a 120-model mental models framework using the framework itself (18-month retrospective)

**Body:**

Sharing a case study from building HUMMBL—a systematic mental models framework for complex problem-solving.

**The meta-recursive twist:** I used the framework's own models to architect, validate, and deploy it.

**Key technical decisions:**

1. **6 transformations, not categories:** Perspective, Inversion, Composition, Decomposition, Recursion, Systems. Every model maps to exactly one.

2. **Base-N scaling:** Base6 for literacy, Base42 for wicked problems, Base120 for pedagogical completeness. Match complexity to problem tier.

3. **Quantitative wickedness scoring:** 5-question rubric (variables, stakeholders, predictability, interdependencies, reversibility) replacing subjective tier assignment.

4. **Multi-agent development:** Treated Claude, ChatGPT, Windsurf, and Cursor as team members with defined roles. SITREP protocol for coordination. 4x parallel execution.

**Results:**
- 120 models, 9.2/10 quality score
- 140 chaos tests, 100% pass rate
- MCP server for Claude Desktop
- 22 months, solo founder

**Tech stack:** React, Cloudflare Workers, D1, TypeScript

**Links:**
- Live: hummbl.io
- MCP: npm @hummbl/mcp-server  
- Case study: https://github.com/hummbl-dev/mcp-server/blob/main/docs/case-study-01-framework-development.md

Would love feedback on the framework architecture and multi-agent coordination approach. AMA about the development process.
