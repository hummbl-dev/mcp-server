## ⚠️ STOP - Read This First

**DO NOT use this public issue template for actual security vulnerabilities!**

For security issues, please use one of these private channels:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories** (Recommended):
   - Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/hummbl-dev/mcp-server/security)
   - Click "Report a vulnerability"
   - This creates a private draft security advisory

2. **Email**: security@hummbl.io
